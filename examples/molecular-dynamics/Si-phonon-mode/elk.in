! Molecular dynamics run of the optical phonon mode in Si. The initial
! conditions are determined by the displacement of the atoms away from
! equilibrium, with the atomic velocities set to zero.

! Atomic displacements are written to the file ATDISPL_TD.OUT and
! ATDISPC_TD.OUT in lattice and Cartesian coordinates, respectively.

! Forces as a function of time are written to the file FORCETOT_TD.OUT. These
! forces may be used in a subsequent TDDFT Ehrenfest calculation with task=462,
! and will produce a back-reaction on the electronic system.

! The file crystal.axsf is written during the run and can be used to produce an
! animation of the atomic motion using XCrySDen.

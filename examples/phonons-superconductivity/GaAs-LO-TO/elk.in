! Phonon dispersion of GaAs calculated with density functional perturbation
! theory (DFPT). Note the large number of radial mesh points required for
! convergence. This is because the gradients calculated in the muffin-tin
! have to be particularly accurate.

! The non-analytic term in the phonon dispersion which results in the LO-TO
! splitting is also included. This requires the additional calculation of the
! Born effective charges and the dielectric tensor.

! Note that the dynamical matrices can also be generated with the supercell
! method. To do this, simply replace task 205 with 200.

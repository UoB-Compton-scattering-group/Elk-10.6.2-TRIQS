                   +------------------------------+

This is an altered elk-10.6.2 version which outputs the required files for the Elk-TRIQS interface. This is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Details of the original Elk README file is at the bottom of this document.

This is written by Alyn D. N. James from the University of Bristol (UoB), United Kingdom. Note that this version is released, but under active development. The intent is to provide an open source FP-LAPW code interfaced with the TRIQS library. Therefore, DFT+DMFT will be more accessible to the community. I would like to thank the Elk and TRIQS developers for their help with this interface.

This interface is open source, but you must cite "A. D. N. James et al., Phys. Rev. B 103, 035106 (2021)" if you use it.

It is recommended to compile Elk using the GNU compilers as this interface has only been tested with those compilers.

Full documentaion of using the interface can be found at https://triqs.github.io/dft_tools/.

There are examples of the Elk part of the interface in the ./examples/Wannier-Projector directory.

If you come across any issue with this interface, please create an issue on this GitHub with a concise description about the problem and how I can reproduce it.

I hope you enjoy using the interface!

Elk can be compiled by first editing the file 'make.inc' in this directory to
suit your compiler and available libraries, followed by running 'make all'.
This will compile the main code as well as several auxiliary programs.

A test suite is available: entering 'make test' will check the output of your
executable against a standard set. This may take some time to complete. If Elk
was compiled with MPI then use 'make test-mpi' instead. The Libxc package can
also be tested using 'make test-libxc' (or 'make test-libxc-mpi' with MPI).

Auxiliary programs include 'spacegroup' for producing crystal geometries from
spacegroup data, and 'eos' for fitting equations of state to energy-volume data.

Elk is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. Features not listed as
'experimental' may be used for production but, as with any code, please check
the consistency of your results carefully.
